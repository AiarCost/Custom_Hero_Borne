This is a semester long project taking what we were taught in Game Systems 1 and creating a game. The base of this game is in the readings of "Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity 2020" by Harrison Ferrone.

There are several added/changed items compared to the book's version such as:
 - Music
 - minimap
 - Audio
 - Invulnerable buff/pickup
 - Health pickup
 - Ammo pickup
 - Changed game's goal from collecting items to kill all enemeis
 - redesigned UI
 - AI constantly hit player
